You are analyzing a codebase to suggest improvements.

## Task
Suggest new features that would add value to users.

## Project Description
exercising fitness home app

## Existing Features (2 total)
- [functional] Display categorized list of available home workout routines
- [functional] Track workout completion, sets, reps, and duration with visual progress indicators and statistics




## Instructions
1. First, explore the codebase to understand:
   - Tech stack and dependencies (check package.json files)
   - Project structure and architecture
   - Existing components, pages, and API endpoints
   - Data models and schemas

2. Then, generate 10 concrete suggestions that:
   - Align with the project's tech stack and architecture
   - Build on existing patterns (don't suggest things already implemented)
   - Are realistic given the current project structure
   - Leverage existing dependencies when possible
   - Reference actual files/components you discovered

3. Format your final response as ONLY a valid JSON array (no markdown, no explanation):
[
  {
    "id": "unique-kebab-case-id",
    "category": "User Experience" | "Security" | "Performance" | "Data" | "Integration" | "Admin",
    "description": "Clear description of what to implement",
    "steps": ["Step 1 referencing actual files", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
    "priority": 1,
    "complexity": "low" | "medium" | "high",
    "reasoning": "Why this fits the existing architecture"
  }
]

IMPORTANT: Your final output must be ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
